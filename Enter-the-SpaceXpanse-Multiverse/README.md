# 1st SpaceXpanse Hackathon: Enter the SpaceXpanse Multiverse
Hackathons play a significant role in the **SpaceXpanse Multiverse** startup ecosystem by fostering innovation, collaboration, and problem-solving. These events bring together a diverse group of individuals with various skills and expertise to work intensively on developing new ideas, products, or solutions within a short timeframe.  

## Rules

1. Team Size: There's no limitation; a team of one is equally eligible as a team of 10.

2. Time Limit: It will end on 23:59, August 31st, 2023.

3. Code of Conduct: See [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

4. Intellectual Property: The source code is licensed under the MIT license /except for XSound module of SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator/, so the licensing of the hackathon's artifacts /output/ has to be the same.

5. Eligibility: 
   - A valid GitHub registration.
   - The project has to be added in **Showcases** category of this repository's [Disscusions](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Hackathon-starter-kit/discussions/categories/showcases) with at least a short name and a description of the idea and its purpose. 
   - The actual contribution to this hackathon will follow the GitHub's [fork-and-pull-model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model).
   - The source code has to be able to be compiled into an output by using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). You can use the code from the ROD core wallet as [working example](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/rod-core-wallet/blob/0.6.8/.github/workflows/build-ubuntu20-macos11.yml). This will reassure everyone that there's no faulty or mischeavous code in the output.
   - The source code has to be licensed under the MIT license.
   - There's no specific skill sets required to participate but some knowledge of [SpaceXpanse Metaverse Simulator](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/Metaverse) /derived from Orbiter Sim/ and [libspex](https://github.com/SpaceXpanse/libspex) /derived from libxayagame/ will be usefull.

7. Project Scope: To make a working MVP/prototype/ of a dApp using the SpaceXpanse Multiverse platform by a set of given tools.  
   Examples:
   - Simple decentralized chat program.
   - Simple NFT creation program.
   - A wallet that uses the ROD blockchain's arbitrary names' system, eg. p/yourname, instead of the accounts's addresses.
   - A simple puzzle game in which users can solve puzzles, complete levels, and compete with others for high scores.
   - Implement the libspex library into the Metaverse Simulator and give some reward in ROD coins when the user reaches a stable Earth's orbit.
